# CompassNotify

Get notifications (via Mac OS X Notification Center) after your css has
been compiled or an error has been found.

## Usage

Add `require 'compass-notify'` to your `config.rb` to get notifications
on successfully saved CSS-files and errors.

Additionally, use `CompassNotify.notify('title', 'message')` in any
other hooks you may have (e.g. compression) to get notifications too.

## Thanks

Thanks to Scott Davis for his
[compass-growl](https://github.com/Compass/compass-growl) which I simply
adapted to Notification Center for those who do not have growl (why
don't they?!).

Thanks to Eloy Dur√°n for his
[terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) without
which I couldn't use Notification Center from within ruby (or cli).
